    "question": "How do I set up my midi device to play Intervallic?",
    "answer": "Launch Intervallic, then plug in the device to your computer as you normally would (most likely with a cable). In the game select \"Midi\" mode when choosing the level you want to play, and it should work! If it does not, for some reason, try unplugging and plugging the device back in while in-game. This is the process you should use for an external computer keyboard or microphone, as well."

This usually does the trick, but if the bug is still persistent, please contact us via our email or Discord server and let us know what happened. We'll try to get back to you as soon as possible and squash that bug!"
