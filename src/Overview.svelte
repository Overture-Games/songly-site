  <Paragraph>
    Over 50% of beginner music students quit in the first 1-2 years of practice.
    After interviewing hundreds of students, parents and teachers, we found that
    the main reason for quitting was because practice is boring, lonely and
    frustrating. Current solutions fail to make practicing fun for everyone, and
    that's where our first game, Intervallic, comes in.
